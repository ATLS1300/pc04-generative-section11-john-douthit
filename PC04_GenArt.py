********* HEY, READ THIS FIRST **********

The title of this piece is "Squarel", sort of like a mix between the word "square" and "spiral." NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH SQUIRREL, RUDE!
I was inspired to try some advanced concepts like modulo and if else to see how it impacted the art. 
The randomly generated corners center the attention on the spiral and fit with the only-square theme.
My hope is that the viewer of this piece feels a sense of chaotic nostalgia, reminscient of the
dreams that spiraled out of their control and reach once they hit adulthood.
